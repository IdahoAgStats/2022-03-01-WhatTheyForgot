## What We Will Cover

- Saving source and blank slates
- Project-oriented workflow
- Safe paths for reproducibility
- Naming files


## Saving source and blank slates

## Saving source and blank slates

- Use an IDE

## Start with a blank slate

## Avoid hidden dependencies

What is wrong with `rm(list = ls())`?

- Falls short of providing a blank slate
- Better strategy is to restart R

## When power-cycling is not practical

- e.g. your analysis contains parts that take a long time to execute
- Modular approach:
  - Break an analysis into logical steps
  - Utilize `saveRDS()` and `readRDS()`
  
## Automating workflow


## Project-oriented workflow: RStudio Projects

- Automatically starts at the working directory for the project (eliminate the need for `setwd("path/that/only/works/on/one/particular/machine")`)
- Easy to switch from project A to project B
- Actual demo?

## RStudio Project with `renv` package

- You can turn it on in Project Options:

## Benefits of working in a project

- File system discipline
- Working directory intentionality
- File path discipline

## Practice safe paths

## Naming files

Ideal file names should be...

- Machine readable
- Human readable
- Plays well with default ordering

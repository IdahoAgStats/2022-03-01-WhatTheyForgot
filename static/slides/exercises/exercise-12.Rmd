You have a data set of 500 random numbers between 1 and 100 that are divided into 5 categories. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(int = sample(1:10, 500, replace = TRUE),
                 category = sample(letters[1:5], 500, replace = TRUE))
head(df)
```

Calculate the mode of each category using `lapply()`. The mode is the most commonly occurring value. If you're unsure how to do this, consider the function `table()` combined with `sort()`. FYI, The R function `mode()` does not compute a mathematical mode (it gives object class information).

## Overview

This is a four-session hands-on workshop designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to redesign their R lifestyle. You will learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis. We will work on project-oriented workflows and how to plan for collaboration, communication, and iteration.

In terms of your R skills, expect to come away with new knowledge of your R installation, how to maintain it, robust strategies for working with the file system, and  debugging tools.

## Is this course for me?

* Have you been using R for a while and feel there might be better ways to organize your R life, but don't know what they are?
* Do you want to streamline your workflow for doing analysis and automating repetitive tasks in R?
* Are you willing to get into the weeds of your R installation, project organization, error messages, and source code?

*You should take this workshop if:*

* You've been using R for a while and you feel like writing R code is not what’s holding you back the most.   
* You’ve realized that you have more pressing "meta" problems that no one seems to talk about.   
* You want to know how to divide your work into projects and scripts, how to expose your work to others, and how to get more connected to the R development scene.  

This course is less focused on actual code (but there will be coding), and more focused on best practices, your R set-up and other important aspects of R programming that are not often explicitly taught.

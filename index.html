<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>This is a two-day hands-on workshop designed for experienced R and RStudio users who want to (re)design their R lifestyle. You&rsquo;ll learn holistic workflows that address the most common sources of friction in data analysis. We‚Äôll work on project-oriented workflows and how to plan for collaboration, communication, and iteration (incl. RMarkdown).</p>
<p>In terms of your R skills, expect to come away with new knowledge of your R installation, how to maintain it, robust strategies for working with the file system, and debugging tools.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-course-for-me">Is this course for me?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have you been using R for a while and feel there might be better ways to organize your R life, but don&rsquo;t know what they are?</li>
<li>Do you want to streamline your workflow for doing analysis and automating repetitive tasks in R?</li>
<li>Are you willing to get into the weeds of your R installation, project organization, error messages, and source code?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>You should take this workshop if:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ve been using R for a while and you feel like writing R code is not what‚Äôs holding you back the most.</li>
<li>You‚Äôve realized that you have more pressing &ldquo;meta&rdquo; problems that no one seems to talk about.</li>
<li>You want to know how to divide your work into projects and scripts, how to expose your work to others, and how to get more connected to the R development scene.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tidyverse is not an explicit focus of the course (other than the purrr segment) and you can certainly work through the content without it. But you should expect a great deal of tidyverse exposure.</p>

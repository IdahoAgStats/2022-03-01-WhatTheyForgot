Can you...

1. Explain the difference between an R source file (e.g. *.R*, *.Rmd*) and the console?   
1. Run an R function after reading the documentation and/or an example?   
1. Import data into R?   
1. Conduct basic mathematical operations in R?   
1. Can explain the difference between a data.frame, a vector, and a list?

If you do not have these skills, this is not the workshop for you. Perhaps you are new to R \ or perhaps you used to program with R but no longer recall the details. That is totally okay! (we've all been there). But, it's not okay to attend this workshop because the instructors have to adjust the content and pace to accommodate you. The result is that everyone's experience is compromised. 

An alternative is to attend a workshop for beginners or engage in self study. Here are some great resources for beginner R learners:

* [Introduction to R](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html)
* [R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/)
